# Norwegian Fan Translations

I, Imre Kristoffer Eilertsen (Main online handle: Dandelion Sprout), have [a large pedigree as a translator of programs, apps, and websites](https://sproutsluckycorner.wordpress.com/2017/11/14/my-work-and-contact-resume/#translations), especially from English to Norwegian.

Frequently I stumble across some programs and apps that don't accept fan translationsâ€¦ but a few of them may still have editable language resource files. Therefore I dedicate this repo and the files within it to everyone who wish for their programs to be a little bit more Norwegian.
